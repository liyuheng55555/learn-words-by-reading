    <!-- ARTICLE -->
    <section class="card article" id="article">
      <h2>Article</h2>
      <p>In the thin <strong id="t-atmosphere">atmosphere</strong> that halos our planet, the oceans of the <strong id="t-hydrosphere">hydrosphere</strong> converse constantly with the rocks of the <strong id="t-lithosphere">lithosphere</strong>. Water vapor rises, condenses, and falls, while winds redistribute heat and trace gases like <strong id="t-oxygen">oxygen</strong>, <strong id="t-hydrogen">hydrogen</strong>, and <strong id="t-carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide</strong>—each a small player with an outsized role in climate and life.</p>
      <p>Beneath our feet, Earth is layered: a molten <strong id="t-core">core</strong>, a convecting <strong id="t-mantle">mantle</strong>, and a brittle <strong id="t-crust">crust</strong>. Where plates grind and pull apart, mountains grow and a <strong id="t-volcano">volcano</strong> may <strong id="t-erupt">erupt</strong>, expelling <strong id="t-magma">magma</strong> that cools into new stone. In those rocks we find history written in <strong id="t-mineral">mineral</strong> grains—veins of metal <strong id="t-ore">ore</strong>, sparkling <strong id="t-quartz">quartz</strong>, mottled <strong id="t-granite">granite</strong>, and polished <strong id="t-marble">marble</strong>. Even a humble <strong id="t-pebble">pebble</strong> is a record of pressure, time, and motion.</p>
      <p>Navigators plot position by <strong id="t-longitude">longitude</strong> and <strong id="t-latitude">latitude</strong>, aviators watch the <strong id="t-horizon">horizon</strong> and adjust for <strong id="t-altitude">altitude</strong>, and scientists track storms as they traverse basins driven by seasonal winds. A warm <strong id="t-breeze">breeze</strong> can swell into a sudden <strong id="t-gust">gust</strong>; monsoon patterns bring the rhythmic <strong id="t-monsoon">monsoon</strong> rains. Over open water, a stiff <strong id="t-gale">gale</strong> may seed a spiraling <strong id="t-hurricane">hurricane</strong>, a land-bound <strong id="t-tornado">tornado</strong>, or a Pacific <strong id="t-typhoon">typhoon</strong>, each capable of <strong id="t-destructive">destructive</strong> power that can <strong id="t-endanger">endanger</strong> communities and <strong id="t-jeopardize">jeopardize</strong> fragile infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Climate itself pulses with oscillations. During <strong id="t-el-nino">El Nino</strong>, the tropical Pacific reorganizes, warming surface waters and perturbing rainfall far from the equator. Such a climate <strong id="t-phenomenon">phenomenon</strong> amplifies extremes—deluges here, <strong id="t-drought">drought</strong> there—and can intensify <strong id="t-flooding">flooding</strong> when saturated soils can’t drink another drop, turning rivers into a brown <strong id="t-torrent">torrent</strong> and slopes into liquid earth.</p>
      <p>Human hands leave signatures, too. In polluted cities, brown <strong id="t-smog">smog</strong> blurs the skyline; factory stacks <strong id="t-fume">fume</strong> while dawn <strong id="t-mist">mist</strong> struggles to lift. Excess <strong id="t-greenhouse">greenhouse</strong> gases such as <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> trap heat, altering <strong id="t-thermodynamic">thermodynamic</strong> gradients that steer winds and storms. On longer timescales, rock and water quietly exchange atoms: iron reddens to an iron <strong id="t-oxide">oxide</strong>, while hydrogen and oxygen cycle through rain, river, and reef as <strong>hydrogen</strong> and <strong>oxygen</strong> recombine in endless chemical choreography.</p>
      <p>In the quiet of a field, a compass needle—a simple <strong id="t-magnet">magnet</strong>—aligns to Earth’s invisible lines, hinting at deep currents of molten iron moving far below. Those same deep processes deliver <strong>ore</strong> that fuels industry and rare <strong>mineral</strong> assemblages prized by collectors, while metamorphic heat recrystallizes <strong>marble</strong> from limestone and threads clear <strong>quartz</strong> through fractures in weathered <strong>granite</strong>.</p>
      <p>Yet nature’s beauty is braided with risk. A minor <strong id="t-mishap">mishap</strong> on a storm-dark road can cascade when culverts clog and cul-de-sacs fill with runoff. On a remote coast, a distant seafloor slide can lift a wall of water into a <strong id="t-tsunami">tsunami</strong>. What begins as a localized <strong id="t-disaster">disaster</strong> can, through unlucky alignment, become <strong id="t-catastrophic">catastrophic</strong>—a regional <strong id="t-calamity">calamity</strong> that tests our designs and our resolve.</p>
      <p>To live well on this animated world is to read its signals: the smell of <strong>fume</strong> on a still morning, the sudden chill of a sea <strong>breeze</strong>, the stacked anvils on the <strong>horizon</strong> before a <strong>gale</strong>. It is to build with stone that remembers—<strong>granite</strong> blocks, <strong>marble</strong> veneers, <strong>quartz</strong> glass—and with systems that respect plate boundaries where <strong>volcano</strong>es may <strong>erupt</strong> and deltas where <strong>flooding</strong> will return. It is also to mind the chemistry we exhale and emit, balancing <strong>greenhouse</strong> budgets so the great engines that knit <strong>atmosphere</strong>, <strong>hydrosphere</strong>, and <strong>lithosphere</strong> keep humming along without tipping us toward the next <strong>catastrophic</strong> chapter.</p>

In the thin **atmosphere** that halos our planet, the oceans of the **hydrosphere** converse constantly with the rocks of the **lithosphere**. Water vapor rises, condenses, and falls, while winds redistribute heat and trace gases like **oxygen**, **hydrogen**, and **carbon dioxide**—each a small player with an outsized role in climate and life.

Beneath our feet, Earth is layered: a molten **core**, a convecting **mantle**, and a brittle **crust**. Where plates grind and pull apart, mountains grow and a **volcano** may **erupt**, expelling **magma** that cools into new stone. In those rocks we find history written in **mineral** grains—veins of metal **ore**, sparkling **quartz**, mottled **granite**, and polished **marble**. Even a humble **pebble** is a record of pressure, time, and motion.
